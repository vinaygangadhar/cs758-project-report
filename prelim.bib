  abstract = {The continued scaling of silicon fabrication technology has led to
    significant reliability concerns, which are quickly becoming a dominant
    design challenge. Design integrity is threatened by complexity challenges
    in the form of immense designs defying complete verification, and
    physical challenges such as silicon aging and soft errors, which
    impair correct system operation. The Gigascale Systems Research Center
    {Resilient-System} Design Team is addressing these key challenges
    through synergistic research thrusts, ranging from near-term reliability
    stress reduction techniques to methods for improving the quality
    of today's silicon, to longer-term technologies that can detect,
    recover, and repair faulty systems. These efforts are supported and
    complemented by an active fault-modeling research effort and a strong
    focus on functional-verification methodologies. The team's goal is
    to provide highly effective, low-cost solutions to ensure both correctness
    and reliability in future designs and technology nodes, thereby extending
    the lifetime of silicon fabrication technologies beyond what can
    be currently foreseen as profitable.},

    may increase the soft-error rates to unacceptable levels in the near

    to address soft-errors, software-based techniques can provide a less
    expensive and more flexible alternative. This paper presents a control-flow
    error classification and proposes two new software-based comprehensive
    control-flow error detection techniques. The new techniques are better
    than the previous ones in the sense that they detect errors in all
    the branch-error categories. We implemented the techniques in our
    dynamic binary translator so that the techniques can be applied to
    existing x86 binaries transparently. We compared our new techniques
    with the previous ones and we show that our methods cover more errors
    while has similar performance overhead.},

  abstract = {Chip multi-processors {(CMPs)} already have widespread commercial
    availability, and technology roadmaps project enough on-chip transistors
    to replicate tens or hundreds of current processor cores. How will
    we express parallelism, partition applications, and schedule/place/migrate
    threads on these highly-parallel {CMPs?This} paper presents and evaluates
    a new approach to highly-parallel {CMPs,} advocating a new hardware-software
    contract. The software layer is encouraged to expose large amounts
    of multi-granular, heterogeneous parallelism. The hardware, meanwhile,
    is designed to offer low-overhead, low-area support for orchestrating
    and modulating this parallelism on {CMPs} at runtime. Specifically,
    our proposed {CMP} architecture consists of architectural and {ISA}
    support targeting thread creation, scheduling and context-switching,
    designed to facilitate effective hardware run-time mapping of threads
    to cores at low {overheads.Dynamic} modulation of parallelism provides
    the ability to respond to run-time variability that arises from dataset
    changes, memory system effects and power spikes and lulls, to name
    a few. It also naturally provides a long-term {CMP} platform with
    performance portability and tolerance to frequency and reliability
    variations across multiple {CMP} generations. Our simulations of
    a range of applications possessing do-all, streaming and recursive
    parallellism show speedups of {4-11.5X} and energy-delay-product
    savings of {3.8X,} on average, on a 16-core vs. a 1-core system.
    This is achieved with modest amounts of hardware support that allows
    for low overheads in thread creation, scheduling and context-switching.
    In particular, our simulations motivated the need for hardware support,
    showing that the large thread management overheads of current run-time
    software systems can lead to up to {6.5X} slowdown. The difficulties
    faced in static scheduling were shown in our simulations with a static
    scheduling algorithm, fed with oracle profiled inputs suffering up
    to 107\% slowdown compared to {NDP's} hardware scheduler, due to
    its inability to handle memory system variabilities. More broadly,
    we feel that the ideas presented here show promise for scaling to
    the systems expected in ten years, where the advantages of high transistor
    counts may be dampened by difficulties in circuit variations and
    reliability. These issues will make dynamic scheduling and adaptation
    mandatory; our proposals represent a first step towards that direction.},

    problem solving environments, have been widely adopted by many computer
    science educators. A related approach is the Treisman model, which
    was originally designed for the first-year calculus course and involves
    intensive workshops where students collaborate in small groups to
    solve problems. We have adapted the model for both the data structures
    and algorithms courses at our institution. Regression analysis indicates
    that students who participate in the workshops for the algorithms
    course perform better (0.561 grade points on a 4-point scale) than
    those who do not, even after accounting for prior academic performance.
    However, the workshops appear to have less of an effect on student
    grades in the data structures course. This study provides evidence
    that the workshop model can be an effective learning environment
    for students in courses primarily involving analysis, but that for
    courses that involve large amounts of programming, further adaptations
    to the model might be needed.},

  abstract = {Process variations are a manufacturing phenomenon that result in some
    parameters of the transistors in a real chip to be different from
    those specified in the design. One impact of these variations is
    that the affected circuits may perform faster or slower than the
    design target. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of chips speed
    up whereas the vast majority incur slow downs. While die-to-die variations
    have been addressed by clock binning, within-die variations are increasing
    in importance with scaling. Clock binning in the presence of within-die
    variations results in slow clock speeds for dies with many components
    that can operate at higher clock speeds. A recent paper addressing
    within-die variations proposes variable-latency functional units
    and register file so that the fast instances of these components
    take fewer clock cycles to operate than the slower instances. However,
    in pipeline stages where the instances are interdependent, the fast
    instances would be held up by the slow instances. Also, variable
    latency may complicate timing-critical instruction scheduling. Instead
    of varying the number of clock cycles, we advocate varying the clock
    speed. Our scheme, called Shapeshifter, maintains high clock speeds
    during {low-ILP} program phases by using a narrower pipeline of only
    the faster instances, and reduces the clock speed only in the {high-ILP}
    phases which use all the instances. Shapeshifter simply turns off
    the slow instances, removing them from any interdependence among
    all the instances. Also, Shapeshifter requires minimal additions
    to the pipeline because almost all pipelines already support varying
    the clock speed for power management purposes. Using simulations,
    we show that Shapeshifter performs better than clock binning and
    the variable-latency approach.},

    43 students. They were 49\% female, 23\% black, and 12\% Hispanic.
    The demographics are different from the typical 1st year class at
    the school, which is 26\% female, 6\% black, and 3\% Hispanic. Two
    important pedagogies differentiated the pilot section from other
    sections: computer availability at all class meetings and the methodology
    for selecting motivating examples. A priori only one student in the
    section intended a computing major, but upon completion the students
    chose a computing major at a higher rate than the rates for other
    sections: 19\% versus 13\%. More striking is that 33\% of the pilot
    section women and 27\% of its minority students chose a computing
    major. All students completed the course and no student left the
    school. These outcomes compare favorably to a school course withdrawal
    rate of 12\% and a school attrition rate of 10\%, a female attrition
    rate of 12\%, and a minority rate attrition of 25\%.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an efficient and robust approach to provide a
    safe execution environment for an entire operating system, such as
    Linux, and all its applications. The approach, which we call Secure
    Virtual Architecture {(SVA),} defines a virtual, low-level, typed
    instruction set suitable for executing all code on a system, including
    kernel and application code. {SVA} code is translated for execution
    by a virtual machine transparently, offline or online. {SVA} aims
    to enforce fine-grained (object level) memory safety, control-flow
    integrity, type safety for a subset of objects, and sound analysis.
    A virtual machine implementing {SVA} achieves these goals by using
    a novel approach that exploits properties of existing memory pools
    in the kernel and by preserving the kernel's explicit control over
    memory, including custom allocators and explicit deallocation. Furthermore,
    the safety properties can be encoded compactly as extensions to the
    {SVA} type system, allowing the (complex) safety checking compiler
    to be outside the trusted computing base. {SVA} also defines a set
    of {OS} interface operations that abstract all privileged hardware
    instructions, allowing the virtual machine to monitor all privileged
    operations and control the physical resources on a given hardware
    platform. We have ported the Linux kernel to {SVA,} treating it as
    a new architecture, and made only minimal code changes (less than
    300 lines of code) to the machine-independent parts of the kernel
    and device drivers. {SVA} is able to prevent 4 out of 5 memory safety
    exploits previously reported for the Linux 2.4.22 kernel for which
    exploit code is available, and would prevent the fifth one simply
    by compiling an additional kernel library.},

    but it has extremely high overheads of 5x-6x and 11x-12x in the two
    versions. In this paper, we describe a collection of techniques that
    dramatically reduce the overhead of this approach, by exploiting
    a fine-grain partitioning of memory called Automatic Pool Allocation.
    Together, these techniques bring the average overhead checks down
    to only 12\% for a set of benchmarks (but 69\% for one case). We
    show that the memory partitioning is key to bringing down this overhead.
    We also show that our technique successfully detects all buffer overrun

  abstract = {By compiling ordinary scientific applications programs with a radical
    technique called trace scheduling, we are generating code for a parallel
    machine that will run these programs faster than an equivalent sequential
    machineâwe expect 10 to 30 times faster. Trace scheduling generates
    code for machines called Very Long Instruction Word architectures.
    In Very Long Instruction Word machines, many statically scheduled,
    tightly coupled, fine-grained operations execute in parallel within
    a single instruction stream. {VLIWs} are more parallel extensions
    of several current architectures. These current architectures have
    never cracked a fundamental barrier. The speedup they get from parallelism
    is never more than a factor of 2 to 3. Not that we couldn't build
    more parallel machines of this type; but until trace scheduling we
    didn't know how to generate code for them. Trace scheduling finds
    sufficient parallelism in ordinary code to justify thinking about
    a highly parallel {VLIW.} At Yale we are actually building one. Our
    machine, the {ELI-512,} has a horizontal instruction word of over
    500 bits and will do 10 to 30 {RISC-level} operations per cycle {[Patterson}
    82]. {ELI} stands for Enormously Longword Instructions; 512 is the
    size of the instruction word we hope to achieve. {(The} current design
    has a 1200-bit instruction word.) Once it became clear that we could
    actually compile code for a {VLIW} machine, some new questions appeared,
    and answers are presented in this paper. How do we put enough tests
    in each cycle without making the machine too big? How do we put enough
    memory references in each cycle without making the machine too slow?},

    kd-tree has gained widespread use in {CPU-based} raytracers and is

    two kd-tree traversal algorithms suitable for {GPU} implementation
    and integrate them into a streaming raytracer. We show that for scenes
    with many objects at different scales, our kd-tree algorithms are
    up to 8 times faster than a uniform grid. In addition, we identify
    load balancing and input data recirculation as two fundamental sources
    of inefficiency when raytracing on current graphics hardware.},

  abstract = {To address the increasing susceptibility of commodity chip multiprocessors
    {(CMPs)} to transient faults, we propose Chip-level Redundantly Threaded
    multiprocessor with Recovery {(CRTR).} {CRTR} extends the previously-proposed
    {CRT} for transient-fault detection in {CMPs,} and the previously-proposed
    {SRTR} for transient-fault recovery in {SMT.} All these schemes achieve
    fault tolerance by executing and comparing two copies, called leading
    and trailing threads, of a given application. Previous recovery schemes
    for {SMT} do not perform well on {CMPs.} In a {CMP,} the leading
    and trailing threads execute on different processors to achieve load
    balancing and reduce the probability of a fault corrupting both threads;
    whereas in an {SMT,} both threads execute on the same processor.
    The interprocessor communication required to compare the threads
    introduces latency and bandwidth problems not present in an {SMT.}
    To hide interprocessor latency, {CRTR} executes the leading thread
    ahead of the trailing thread by maintaining a long slack, enabled
    by asymmetric commit. {CRTR} commits the leading thread before checking
    and the trailing thread after checking, so that the trailing thread
    state may be used for recovery. Previous recovery schemes commit
    both threads after checking, making a long slack suboptimal. To tackle
    interprocessor bandwidth, {CRTR} not only increases the bandwidth
    supply by pipelining the communication paths, but also reduces the
    bandwidth demand. By reasoning that faults propagate through dependences,
    previously-proposed dependence based checking elision {(DBCE)} exploits
    (true) register dependence chains so that only the value of the last
    instruction in a chain is checked. However, instructions that mask
    operand bits may mask faults and limit the use of dependence chains.
    We propose death-and dependence-based checking elision {(DDBCE),}
    which chains a masking instruction only if the source operand of
    the instruction dies after the instruction. Register deaths ensure
    that masked faults do not corrupt later computation. Using {SPEC2000,}
    we show that {CRTR} incurs negligible performance loss compared to
    {CRT} for interprocessor (one-way) latency as high as 30 cycles,
    and that the bandwidth requirements of {CRT} and {CRTR} with {DDBCE}
    are 5.2 and 7.1 bytes/cycle, respectively.},

    aids programmers in detecting complex program errors and identifying
    their root causes. By instrumenting a program and observing its behavior
    as it runs, {DIDUCE} dynamically formulates hypotheses of invariants
    obeyed by the program. {DIDUCE} hypothesizes the strictest invariants
    at the beginning, and gradually relaxes the hypothesis as violations
    are detected to allow for new behavior. The violations reported help
    users to catch software bugs as soon as they occur. They also give
    programmers new visibility into the behavior of the programs such
    as identifying rare corner cases in the program logic or even locating
    hidden errors that corrupt the program's {results.We} implemented
    the {DIDUCE} system for Java programs and applied it to four programs
    of significant size and complexity. {DIDUCE} succeeded in identifying
    the root causes of programming errors in each of the programs quickly
    and automatically. In particular, {DIDUCE} is effective in isolating
    a timing-dependent bug in a released {JSSE} {(Java} Secure Socket
    Extension) library, which would have taken an experienced programmer
    days to find. Our experience suggests that detecting and checking
    program invariants dynamically is a simple and effective methodology
    for debugging many different kinds of program errors across a wide
    variety of application domains.},

  abstract = {Microprocessor design is undergoing a major paradigm shift towards
    multi-core designs, in anticipation that future performance gains
    will come from exploiting threadlevel parallelism in the software.
    To support this trend, we present a novel processor architecture
    called the Multiple Instruction Stream Processing {(MISP)} architecture.
    {MISP} introduces the sequencer as a new category of architectural
    resource, and defines a canonical set of instructions to support
    user-level inter-sequencer signaling and asynchronous control transfer.
    {MISP} allows an application program to directly manage user-level
    threads without {OS} intervention. By supporting the classic cache-coherent
    shared-memory programming model, {MISP} does not require a radical
    shift in the multithreaded programming paradigm. This paper describes
    the design and evaluation of the {MISP} architecture for the {IA-32}
    family of microprocessors. Using a research prototype {MISP} processor
    built on an {IA-32-based} multiprocessor system equipped with special
    firmware, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the {MISP}
    architecture. We then examine the utility of {MISP} by (1) assessing
    the key architectural tradeoffs of the {MISP} architecture design
    and (2) showing how legacy multithreaded applications can be migrated
    to {MISP} with relative ease.},

    pipelining can at best improve performance of integer programs by
    a factor of 2 over current designs. At these high clock frequencies
    it will be difficult to design the instruction issue window to operate
    in a single cycle. Consequently, we propose and evaluate a high-frequency

    and analyzed. The objectives are high performance and reduced complexity.
    Although the x86 {ISA} is targeted, the overall approach is applicable
    to other {CISC} {ISAs.} To provide high performance on frequently
    executed code sequences, fully transparent dynamic translation software
    decomposes {CISC} superblocks into {RISC-style} micro-ops. Then,
    pairs of dependent micro-ops are reordered and fused into macro-ops
    held in a large, concealed code cache. The macro-ops are fetched
    from the code cache and processed throughout the pipeline as single
    units. Consequently, instruction level communication and management
    are reduced, and processor resources such as the issue buffer and
    register file ports are better utilized. Moreover, fused instructions
    lead naturally to pipelined instruction scheduling (issue) logic,
    and collapsed 3-1 {ALUs} can be used, resulting in much simplified
    result forwarding logic. Steady state performance is evaluated for
    the {SPEC2000} benchmarks, and a proposed x86 implementation with
    complexity similar to a two-wide superscalar processor is shown to
    provide performance (instructions per cycle) that is equivalent to
    a conventional four-wide superscalar processor.},

    converts code written for a conventional (legacy) {ISA} into optimized
    code for an underlying implementation-specific {ISA.} Because translation
    is done dynamically, an important consideration in such systems is
    the startup time for performing the initial translations. Beginning
    with a previously proposed co-designed {VM} that implements the x86
    {ISA,} we study runtime binary translation overhead effects. The
    co-designed x86 virtual machine is based on an adaptive translation
    system that uses a basic block translator for initial emulation and
    a superblock translator for hotspot optimization. We analyze and
    model {VM} startup performance via simulation. We observe that non-hotspot
    emulation via basic block translation is the major part of the startup
    overhead. To reduce startup translation overhead, we follow the co-designed
    hardware/software philosophy and propose hardware assists to dramatically
    accelerate basic block translations. By combining hardware assists
    with balanced translation strategies, the co-designed translation
    system reduces runtime overhead significantly and demonstrates very
    competitive startup performance when compared with conventional processors

    that supports instruction fusing. A microarchitecture that is codesigned

    machine. The dynamic binary translator first cracks x86 instructions
    belonging to hot superblocks into {RISC-style} microoperations, and
    then uses heuristics to fuse together pairs of dependent microoperations.
    Experimental results with {SPEC2000} integer benchmarks demonstrate
    that: (1) the fused {ISA} with dynamic binary translation reduces
    the number of scheduling decisions by about 30\% versus a conventional
    implementation that uses hardware cracking into {RISC} microoperations;
    (2) an instruction scheduling slot needs only hold two source register
    fields even though it may hold two instructions; (3) translations

    Three different optimizations are proposed and evaluated namely migratory

    optimizations, and instruction-based predictor, using fewer predictor
    entries, is shown to outperform address-based schemes, and low mis-speculation
    rates show promise for performance improvement in the third scheme.
    Instruction-based scheme uses far fewer bits than address-based scheme

    the taxonomy are provided and analyzed to see which components of
    each scheme contribute the most to prediction accuracy. The authors
    use both sensitivity and PVP to measure the efficacy of sharing prediction
    schemes and study tradeoffs. High PVP schemes have low sensitivity
    and miss many opportunities for sharing but generate low extra traffic.
    High sensitivity schemes win more often in absolute terms but also
    generate more traffic. Thus there is a badnwidth-latency tradefoff:
    With high bandwidth we should use a high sensitivity scheme.}

    (SWI) heuristic predicts when a producer is done writing, invalidates
    the copy speculatively, and forwards the block to the consumers.
    The second technique uses read requests from first consumer to forward
    copies to the other consumers. The read request technique results
    in 8\% average and 17\% max reduction in execution time. The SWI
    approach reduces execution time on average by 12\% and at best 24\%.}

  abstract = {This paper describes Automatic Pool Allocation, a transformation framework
    that segregates distinct instances of heap-based data structures
    into seperate memory pools and allows heuristics to be used to partially
    control the internal layout of those data structures. The primary
    goal of this work is performance improvement, not automatic memory
    management, and the paper makes several new contributions. The key
    contribution is a new compiler algorithm for partitioning heap objects
    in imperative programs based on a context-sensitive pointer analysis,
    including a novel strategy for correct handling of indirect (and
    potentially unsafe) function calls. The transformation does not require
    type safe programs and works for the full generality of C and C++.
    Second, the paper describes several optimizations that exploit data
    structure partitioning to further improve program performance. Third,
    the paper evaluates how memory hierarchy behavior and overall program
    performance are impacted by the new transformations. Using a number
    of benchmarks and a few applications, we find that compilation times
    are extremely low, and overall running times for heap intensive programs
    speed up by 10-25\% in many cases, about 2x in two cases, and more
    than 10x in two small benchmarks. Overall, we believe this work provides
    a new framework for optimizing pointer intensive programs by segregating
    and controlling the layout of heap-based data structures.},

  abstract = {A significant fraction of the circuitry in a modern processor is dedicated
    to converting the linear instruction stream into a representation
    that allows the execution of instructions in data dependence order,
    rather than program order, to extract instruction level parallelism.
    All errors caused by hardware faults in this circuitry-- which includes
    the fetch and decode stages, renaming and scheduling logic, as well
    as the commit stage--will manifest themselves as incorrectly constructed
    dataflow graphs. Dynamic Dataflow Verification {(DDFV)} compares
    the dynamically constructed and executed dataflow graph to the expected
    dataflow graph of the static program binary, represented by a signature
    embedded in the instruction stream. The signature comparison enables
    comprehensive detection of transient errors, permanent errors, and
    design bugs in the dataflow circuitry. We show that {DDFV} detects
    errors with high probability, at a low hardware and performance cost.},

    maximize the error detection coverage for a target application. The
    paper also presents an automatic framework for synthesizing the set

    computation and molecular probes to form nanoscale sensor processors

    automate tasks that currently require expert scientific training
    and costly equipment. This new application domain severely constrains
    {nSP} size, which significantly impacts the architectural design
    space. In this context, we explore {nSP} architectures and present
    an {nSP} design that includes a simple accumulator-based {ISA,} sensors,
    limited memory and communication transceivers. To reduce the application
    memory footprint, we introduce the concept of instruction-fused sensing.
    We use simulation and analytical models to evaluate {nSP} designs
    executing a representative set of target applications. Furthermore,
    we propose a candidate {nSP} technology based on optical Resonance
    Energy Transfer {(RET)} logic that enables the small size required
    by the application domain; our smallest design is about the size
    of the largest known virus. We also show laboratory results that
    demonstrate initial steps towards a prototype.},

    that can probabilistically detect if a transient fault has affected
    the state of a processor. We demonstrate that fault screeners function
    because of two key characteristics. First, we show that much of the
    intermediate data generated by a program inherently falls within
    certain consistent bounds. Second, we observe that these bounds are
    often violated by the introduction of a fault. Thus, fault screeners
    can identify faults by directly watching for any data inconsistencies
    arising in an application's behavior. We present an idealized algorithm
    capable of identifying over 85\% of injected faults on the {SpecInt}
    suite and over 75\% overall. Further, in a realistic implementation
    on a simulated {Pentium-III-like} processor, about half of the errors
    due to injected faults are identified while still in speculative
    state. Errors detected this early can be eliminated by a pipeline
    flush. In this paper, we present several hardware-based versions
    of this screening algorithm and show that flushing the pipeline every
    time the hardware screener triggers reduces overall performance by
    less than 1\%},

  abstract = {As chip densities and clock rates increase, processors are becoming
    more susceptible to transient faults that can affect program correctness.
    Up to now, system designers have primarily considered hardware-only
    and software-only fault-detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate
    the deleterious effects of transient faults. These two fault-detection
    systems, however, are extremes in the design space, representing
    sharp trade-offs between hardware cost, reliability, and performance.
    In this paper, we identify hybrid hardware/software fault-detection
    mechanisms as promising alternatives to hardware-only and software-only
    systems. These hybrid systems offer designers more options to fit
    their reliability needs within their hardware and performance budgets.
    We propose and evaluate {CRAFT,} a suite of three such hybrid techniques,
    to illustrate the potential of the hybrid approach. For fair, quantitative
    comparisons among hardware, software, and hybrid systems, we introduce
    a new metric, mean work to failure, which is able to compare systems
    for which machine instructions do not represent a constant unit of
    work. Additionally, we present a new simulation framework which rapidly
    assesses reliability and does not depend on manual identification
    of failure modes. Our evaluation illustrates that {CRAFT,} and hybrid
    techniques in general, offer attractive options in the fault-detection
    design space.},

    injected to stress the processor while it is executing selected applications.
    Analysis of the collected data shows that fault sensitivity of the
    combinational logic (4.2\% for a fault duration of one clock cycle)
    is not negligible, even though it is smaller than the fault sensitivity
    of flip-flops (10.4\%). Detailed study of the error impact, measured
    at the application level, reveals that errors in speculation and
    control blocks collectively contribute to about 34\% of crashes,
    34\% of fail-silent violations and 69\% of application incomplete
    executions. These figures indicate the increasing need for processor-level
    detection techniques over generic methods, such as {ECC} and parity,
    to prevent such errors from propagating beyond the processor boundaries.},

    effective means for education. Several methods have been proposed
    to achieve this engagement for computer science and other disciplines.
    Active learning is one such technique that incorporates interactive
    classroom activities to reinforce concepts and involve the students.
    Visualizations of computer science concepts such as algorithm animations
    can be used for these activities. To be most effective in this environment,
    they need to be designed and used with active learning in mind. This
    paper describes the design characteristics of such visualizations,
    ways of using them in the classroom, and our experience with developing
    and using visualization tools across different courses in the computer
    science curriculum.},

    mechanism to support multiple long-latency fault detection schemes.
    SafetyNect maintains multiple, globally consistent checkpoints of
    state and recovers to a pre-fault checkpoint when a fault is detected.
    Performance overhead is minimized by pipelining checkpoint validation
    with subsequent parallel execution. Using full-system simulation
    of a 16-way multiprocessor system, the paper shows that SafetyNet
    adds statistically insignificant runtime overhead in the common-case
    (adds no latency to 99.99\% of all instructions) and avoids a crash
    when tolerated faults occur. }

  abstract = {We propose a scheme for transient-fault recovery called Simultaneously,
    and Redundantly Threaded processors with Recovery {(SRTR)} that enhances
    a previously proposed scheme for transient-fault detection, called
    Simultaneously and Redundantly Threaded {(SRT)} processors. {SRT}
    replicates an application into two communicating threads, one executing
    ahead of the other. The trailing thread repeats the computation performed
    by the leading thread, and the values produced by the two threads
    are compared. In {SRT} a leading instruction may commit before the
    check for faults occurs, relying on the trailing thread to trigger
    detection. In contrast, {SRTR} must not allow any leading instruction
    to commit before checking occurs, since a faulty instruction cannot
    be undone once the instruction commits. To avoid stalling leading
    instructions at commit while waiting for their trailing counterparts,
    {SRTR} exploits the time between the completion and commit of leading
    instructions. {SRTR} compares the leading and trailing values as
    soon as the trailing instruction completes, typically before the
    leading instruction reaches the commit point. To avoid increasing
    the bandwidth demand on the register file for checking register values,
    {SRTR} uses the register value queue {(RVQ)} to hold register values
    for checking. To reduce the bandwidth pressure on the {RVQ} itself
    {SRTR} employs dependence-based checking elision {(DBCE).} By reasoning
    that faults propagate through dependent instructions, {DBCE} exploits
    register (true) dependence chains so that only the last instruction
    in a chain uses the {RVQ,} and has the leading and trailing values
    checked. {SRTR} performs within 1\% and 7\% of {SRT} for {SPEC95}
    integer and floating-point programs, respectively. While {SRTR} without
    {DBCE} incurs about 18\% performance loss when the number of {RVQ}
    ports is reduced from four (which is performance-equivalent to an
    unlimited number) to two ports, with {DBCE,} a two-ported {RVQ} performs
    within 2\% of a four-ported {RVQ}},

    In this paper, we present a software approach to implementing fault
    isolation within a single address {space.Our} approach has two parts.
    First, we load the code and data for a distrusted module into its
    own fault do main, a logically separate portion of the application's
    address space. Second, we modify the object code of a distrusted
    module to prevent it from writing or jumping to an address outside
    its fault domain. Both these software operations are portable and
    programming language {independent.Our} approach poses a tradeoff
    relative to hardware fault isolation: substantially faster communication
    between fault domains, at a cost of slightly increased execution
    time for distrusted modules. We demonstrate that for frequently communicating
    modules, implementing fault isolation in software rather than hardware
    can substantially improve end-to-end application performance.},

  abstract = {Dynamic optimization has the potential to adapt the program's behavior
    at run-time to deliver performance improvements over static optimization.
    Dynamic optimization systems usually perform their optimization in
    series with the application's execution. This incurs overhead which
    reduces the benefit of dynamic optimization, and prevents some aggressive
    optimizations from being performed. In this paper we propose a new
    dynamic optimization framework called Trident. Concurrent with the
    program's execution, the framework uses hardware support to identify
    optimization opportunities, and uses spare threads on a multithreaded
    processor to perform dynamic optimizations for these optimization
    events. We evaluate the benefit of using Trident to guide code layout,
    basic compiler optimizations, and value specialization. Our results
    show that using Trident with these optimizations achieves an average
    20\% speedup, and is complementary with other memory latency tolerant
    techniques, such as prefetching.},

	significant reliability concerns, which are quickly becoming a dominant
	design challenge. Design integrity is threatened by complexity challenges
	in the form of immense designs defying complete verification, and
	physical challenges such as silicon aging and soft errors, which
	impair correct system operation. The Gigascale Systems Research Center
	{Resilient-System} Design Team is addressing these key challenges
	through synergistic research thrusts, ranging from near-term reliability
	stress reduction techniques to methods for improving the quality
	of today's silicon, to longer-term technologies that can detect,
	recover, and repair faulty systems. These efforts are supported and
	complemented by an active fault-modeling research effort and a strong
	focus on functional-verification methodologies. The team's goal is
	to provide highly effective, low-cost solutions to ensure both correctness
	and reliability in future designs and technology nodes, thereby extending
	the lifetime of silicon fabrication technologies beyond what can
	be currently foreseen as profitable.},

	may increase the soft-error rates to unacceptable levels in the near

	to address soft-errors, software-based techniques can provide a less
	expensive and more flexible alternative. This paper presents a control-flow
	error classification and proposes two new software-based comprehensive
	control-flow error detection techniques. The new techniques are better
	than the previous ones in the sense that they detect errors in all
	the branch-error categories. We implemented the techniques in our
	dynamic binary translator so that the techniques can be applied to
	existing x86 binaries transparently. We compared our new techniques
	with the previous ones and we show that our methods cover more errors
	while has similar performance overhead.},

  abstract = {Chip multi-processors {(CMPs)} already have widespread commercial
	availability, and technology roadmaps project enough on-chip transistors
	to replicate tens or hundreds of current processor cores. How will
	we express parallelism, partition applications, and schedule/place/migrate
	threads on these highly-parallel {CMPs?This} paper presents and evaluates
	a new approach to highly-parallel {CMPs,} advocating a new hardware-software
	contract. The software layer is encouraged to expose large amounts
	of multi-granular, heterogeneous parallelism. The hardware, meanwhile,
	is designed to offer low-overhead, low-area support for orchestrating
	and modulating this parallelism on {CMPs} at runtime. Specifically,
	our proposed {CMP} architecture consists of architectural and {ISA}
	support targeting thread creation, scheduling and context-switching,
	designed to facilitate effective hardware run-time mapping of threads
	to cores at low {overheads.Dynamic} modulation of parallelism provides
	the ability to respond to run-time variability that arises from dataset
	changes, memory system effects and power spikes and lulls, to name
	a few. It also naturally provides a long-term {CMP} platform with
	performance portability and tolerance to frequency and reliability
	variations across multiple {CMP} generations. Our simulations of
	a range of applications possessing do-all, streaming and recursive
	parallellism show speedups of {4-11.5X} and energy-delay-product
	savings of {3.8X,} on average, on a 16-core vs. a 1-core system.
	This is achieved with modest amounts of hardware support that allows
	for low overheads in thread creation, scheduling and context-switching.
	In particular, our simulations motivated the need for hardware support,
	showing that the large thread management overheads of current run-time
	software systems can lead to up to {6.5X} slowdown. The difficulties
	faced in static scheduling were shown in our simulations with a static
	scheduling algorithm, fed with oracle profiled inputs suffering up
	to 107\% slowdown compared to {NDP's} hardware scheduler, due to
	its inability to handle memory system variabilities. More broadly,
	we feel that the ideas presented here show promise for scaling to
	the systems expected in ten years, where the advantages of high transistor
	counts may be dampened by difficulties in circuit variations and
	reliability. These issues will make dynamic scheduling and adaptation
	mandatory; our proposals represent a first step towards that direction.},

	that students who participate in the workshops for the algorithms
	course perform better (0.561 grade points on a 4-point scale) than
	those who do not, even after accounting for prior academic performance.
	However, the workshops appear to have less of an effect on student
	grades in the data structures course. This study provides evidence
	that the workshop model can be an effective learning environment
	for students in courses primarily involving analysis, but that for
	courses that involve large amounts of programming, further adaptations
	to the model might be needed.},

	parameters of the transistors in a real chip to be different from
	those specified in the design. One impact of these variations is
	that the affected circuits may perform faster or slower than the
	design target. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of chips speed
	up whereas the vast majority incur slow downs. While die-to-die variations
	have been addressed by clock binning, within-die variations are increasing
	in importance with scaling. Clock binning in the presence of within-die
	variations results in slow clock speeds for dies with many components
	that can operate at higher clock speeds. A recent paper addressing
	within-die variations proposes variable-latency functional units
	and register file so that the fast instances of these components
	take fewer clock cycles to operate than the slower instances. However,
	in pipeline stages where the instances are interdependent, the fast
	instances would be held up by the slow instances. Also, variable
	latency may complicate timing-critical instruction scheduling. Instead
	of varying the number of clock cycles, we advocate varying the clock
	speed. Our scheme, called Shapeshifter, maintains high clock speeds
	during {low-ILP} program phases by using a narrower pipeline of only
	the faster instances, and reduces the clock speed only in the {high-ILP}
	phases which use all the instances. Shapeshifter simply turns off
	the slow instances, removing them from any interdependence among
	all the instances. Also, Shapeshifter requires minimal additions
	to the pipeline because almost all pipelines already support varying
	the clock speed for power management purposes. Using simulations,
	we show that Shapeshifter performs better than clock binning and
	the variable-latency approach.},

	safe execution environment for an entire operating system, such as
	Linux, and all its applications. The approach, which we call Secure
	Virtual Architecture {(SVA),} defines a virtual, low-level, typed
	instruction set suitable for executing all code on a system, including
	kernel and application code. {SVA} code is translated for execution
	by a virtual machine transparently, offline or online. {SVA} aims
	to enforce fine-grained (object level) memory safety, control-flow
	integrity, type safety for a subset of objects, and sound analysis.
	A virtual machine implementing {SVA} achieves these goals by using
	a novel approach that exploits properties of existing memory pools
	in the kernel and by preserving the kernel's explicit control over
	memory, including custom allocators and explicit deallocation. Furthermore,
	the safety properties can be encoded compactly as extensions to the
	{SVA} type system, allowing the (complex) safety checking compiler
	to be outside the trusted computing base. {SVA} also defines a set
	of {OS} interface operations that abstract all privileged hardware
	instructions, allowing the virtual machine to monitor all privileged
	operations and control the physical resources on a given hardware
	platform. We have ported the Linux kernel to {SVA,} treating it as
	a new architecture, and made only minimal code changes (less than
	300 lines of code) to the machine-independent parts of the kernel
	and device drivers. {SVA} is able to prevent 4 out of 5 memory safety
	exploits previously reported for the Linux 2.4.22 kernel for which
	exploit code is available, and would prevent the fifth one simply
	by compiling an additional kernel library.},

	in C and C++ programs remains unsolved. The approach proposed by
	Jones and Kelly (extended by Ruwase and Lam) is the only one we know
	of that does not require significant manual changes to programs,
	but it has extremely high overheads of 5x-6x and 11x-12x in the two
	versions. In this paper, we describe a collection of techniques that
	dramatically reduce the overhead of this approach, by exploiting
	a fine-grain partitioning of memory called Automatic Pool Allocation.
	Together, these techniques bring the average overhead checks down
	to only 12\% for a set of benchmarks (but 69\% for one case). We
	show that the memory partitioning is key to bringing down this overhead.
	We also show that our technique successfully detects all buffer overrun
	violations in a test suite modeling reported violations in some important
	real-world programs.},

  abstract = {By compiling ordinary scientific applications programs with a radical
	technique called trace scheduling, we are generating code for a parallel
	machine that will run these programs faster than an equivalent sequential
	machineâwe expect 10 to 30 times faster. Trace scheduling generates
	code for machines called Very Long Instruction Word architectures.
	In Very Long Instruction Word machines, many statically scheduled,
	tightly coupled, fine-grained operations execute in parallel within
	a single instruction stream. {VLIWs} are more parallel extensions
	of several current architectures. These current architectures have
	never cracked a fundamental barrier. The speedup they get from parallelism
	is never more than a factor of 2 to 3. Not that we couldn't build
	more parallel machines of this type; but until trace scheduling we
	didn't know how to generate code for them. Trace scheduling finds
	sufficient parallelism in ordinary code to justify thinking about
	a highly parallel {VLIW.} At Yale we are actually building one. Our
	machine, the {ELI-512,} has a horizontal instruction word of over
	500 bits and will do 10 to 30 {RISC-level} operations per cycle {[Patterson}
	82]. {ELI} stands for Enormously Longword Instructions; 512 is the
	size of the instruction word we hope to achieve. {(The} current design
	has a 1200-bit instruction word.) Once it became clear that we could
	actually compile code for a {VLIW} machine, some new questions appeared,
	and answers are presented in this paper. How do we put enough tests
	in each cycle without making the machine too big? How do we put enough
	memory references in each cycle without making the machine too slow?},

  abstract = {To address the increasing susceptibility of commodity chip multiprocessors
	{(CMPs)} to transient faults, we propose Chip-level Redundantly Threaded
	multiprocessor with Recovery {(CRTR).} {CRTR} extends the previously-proposed
	{CRT} for transient-fault detection in {CMPs,} and the previously-proposed
	{SRTR} for transient-fault recovery in {SMT.} All these schemes achieve
	fault tolerance by executing and comparing two copies, called leading
	and trailing threads, of a given application. Previous recovery schemes
	for {SMT} do not perform well on {CMPs.} In a {CMP,} the leading
	and trailing threads execute on different processors to achieve load
	balancing and reduce the probability of a fault corrupting both threads;
	whereas in an {SMT,} both threads execute on the same processor.
	The interprocessor communication required to compare the threads
	introduces latency and bandwidth problems not present in an {SMT.}
	To hide interprocessor latency, {CRTR} executes the leading thread
	ahead of the trailing thread by maintaining a long slack, enabled
	by asymmetric commit. {CRTR} commits the leading thread before checking
	and the trailing thread after checking, so that the trailing thread
	state may be used for recovery. Previous recovery schemes commit
	both threads after checking, making a long slack suboptimal. To tackle
	interprocessor bandwidth, {CRTR} not only increases the bandwidth
	supply by pipelining the communication paths, but also reduces the
	bandwidth demand. By reasoning that faults propagate through dependences,
	previously-proposed dependence based checking elision {(DBCE)} exploits
	(true) register dependence chains so that only the value of the last
	instruction in a chain is checked. However, instructions that mask
	operand bits may mask faults and limit the use of dependence chains.
	We propose death-and dependence-based checking elision {(DDBCE),}
	which chains a masking instruction only if the source operand of
	the instruction dies after the instruction. Register deaths ensure
	that masked faults do not corrupt later computation. Using {SPEC2000,}
	we show that {CRTR} incurs negligible performance loss compared to
	{CRT} for interprocessor (one-way) latency as high as 30 cycles,
	and that the bandwidth requirements of {CRT} and {CRTR} with {DDBCE}
	are 5.2 and 7.1 bytes/cycle, respectively.},

	aids programmers in detecting complex program errors and identifying
	their root causes. By instrumenting a program and observing its behavior
	as it runs, {DIDUCE} dynamically formulates hypotheses of invariants
	obeyed by the program. {DIDUCE} hypothesizes the strictest invariants
	at the beginning, and gradually relaxes the hypothesis as violations
	are detected to allow for new behavior. The violations reported help
	users to catch software bugs as soon as they occur. They also give
	programmers new visibility into the behavior of the programs such
	as identifying rare corner cases in the program logic or even locating
	hidden errors that corrupt the program's {results.We} implemented
	the {DIDUCE} system for Java programs and applied it to four programs
	of significant size and complexity. {DIDUCE} succeeded in identifying
	the root causes of programming errors in each of the programs quickly
	and automatically. In particular, {DIDUCE} is effective in isolating
	a timing-dependent bug in a released {JSSE} {(Java} Secure Socket
	Extension) library, which would have taken an experienced programmer
	days to find. Our experience suggests that detecting and checking
	program invariants dynamically is a simple and effective methodology
	for debugging many different kinds of program errors across a wide
	variety of application domains.},

	multi-core designs, in anticipation that future performance gains
	will come from exploiting threadlevel parallelism in the software.
	To support this trend, we present a novel processor architecture
	called the Multiple Instruction Stream Processing {(MISP)} architecture.
	{MISP} introduces the sequencer as a new category of architectural
	resource, and defines a canonical set of instructions to support
	user-level inter-sequencer signaling and asynchronous control transfer.
	{MISP} allows an application program to directly manage user-level
	threads without {OS} intervention. By supporting the classic cache-coherent
	shared-memory programming model, {MISP} does not require a radical
	shift in the multithreaded programming paradigm. This paper describes
	the design and evaluation of the {MISP} architecture for the {IA-32}
	family of microprocessors. Using a research prototype {MISP} processor
	built on an {IA-32-based} multiprocessor system equipped with special
	firmware, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the {MISP}
	architecture. We then examine the utility of {MISP} by (1) assessing
	the key architectural tradeoffs of the {MISP} architecture design
	and (2) showing how legacy multithreaded applications can be migrated
	to {MISP} with relative ease.},

	on the dynamic binary translator for such a codesigned x86 virtual
	machine. The dynamic binary translator first cracks x86 instructions
	belonging to hot superblocks into {RISC-style} microoperations, and
	then uses heuristics to fuse together pairs of dependent microoperations.
	Experimental results with {SPEC2000} integer benchmarks demonstrate
	that: (1) the fused {ISA} with dynamic binary translation reduces
	the number of scheduling decisions by about 30\% versus a conventional
	implementation that uses hardware cracking into {RISC} microoperations;
	(2) an instruction scheduling slot needs only hold two source register
	fields even though it may hold two instructions; (3) translations
	generated in the proposed {ISA} consume about 30\% less storage than
	a corresponding fixed-length {RISC-style} {ISA.}},

	use two techniques to trigger speculation. Speculative Write Invalidation
	(SWI) heuristic predicts when a producer is done writing, invalidates
	the copy speculatively, and forwards the block to the consumers.
	The second technique uses read requests from first consumer to forward
	copies to the other consumers. The read request technique results

	that segregates distinct instances of heap-based data structures
	into seperate memory pools and allows heuristics to be used to partially
	control the internal layout of those data structures. The primary
	goal of this work is performance improvement, not automatic memory
	management, and the paper makes several new contributions. The key
	contribution is a new compiler algorithm for partitioning heap objects
	in imperative programs based on a context-sensitive pointer analysis,
	including a novel strategy for correct handling of indirect (and
	potentially unsafe) function calls. The transformation does not require
	type safe programs and works for the full generality of C and C++.
	Second, the paper describes several optimizations that exploit data
	structure partitioning to further improve program performance. Third,
	the paper evaluates how memory hierarchy behavior and overall program
	performance are impacted by the new transformations. Using a number
	of benchmarks and a few applications, we find that compilation times
	are extremely low, and overall running times for heap intensive programs
	speed up by 10-25\% in many cases, about 2x in two cases, and more
	than 10x in two small benchmarks. Overall, we believe this work provides
	a new framework for optimizing pointer intensive programs by segregating
	and controlling the layout of heap-based data structures.},

	to converting the linear instruction stream into a representation
	that allows the execution of instructions in data dependence order,
	rather than program order, to extract instruction level parallelism.
	All errors caused by hardware faults in this circuitry-- which includes
	the fetch and decode stages, renaming and scheduling logic, as well
	as the commit stage--will manifest themselves as incorrectly constructed
	dataflow graphs. Dynamic Dataflow Verification {(DDFV)} compares
	the dynamically constructed and executed dataflow graph to the expected
	dataflow graph of the static program binary, represented by a signature
	embedded in the instruction stream. The signature comparison enables
	comprehensive detection of transient errors, permanent errors, and
	design bugs in the dataflow circuitry. We show that {DDFV} detects
	errors with high probability, at a low hardware and performance cost.},

	that can probabilistically detect if a transient fault has affected

	intermediate data generated by a program inherently falls within
	certain consistent bounds. Second, we observe that these bounds are
	often violated by the introduction of a fault. Thus, fault screeners
	can identify faults by directly watching for any data inconsistencies
	arising in an application's behavior. We present an idealized algorithm
	capable of identifying over 85\% of injected faults on the {SpecInt}
	suite and over 75\% overall. Further, in a realistic implementation
	on a simulated {Pentium-III-like} processor, about half of the errors
	due to injected faults are identified while still in speculative
	state. Errors detected this early can be eliminated by a pipeline
	flush. In this paper, we present several hardware-based versions
	of this screening algorithm and show that flushing the pipeline every
	time the hardware screener triggers reduces overall performance by
	less than 1\%},

  abstract = {As chip densities and clock rates increase, processors are becoming
	more susceptible to transient faults that can affect program correctness.
	Up to now, system designers have primarily considered hardware-only
	and software-only fault-detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate
	the deleterious effects of transient faults. These two fault-detection
	systems, however, are extremes in the design space, representing
	sharp trade-offs between hardware cost, reliability, and performance.
	In this paper, we identify hybrid hardware/software fault-detection
	mechanisms as promising alternatives to hardware-only and software-only
	systems. These hybrid systems offer designers more options to fit
	their reliability needs within their hardware and performance budgets.
	We propose and evaluate {CRAFT,} a suite of three such hybrid techniques,
	to illustrate the potential of the hybrid approach. For fair, quantitative
	comparisons among hardware, software, and hybrid systems, we introduce
	a new metric, mean work to failure, which is able to compare systems
	for which machine instructions do not represent a constant unit of
	work. Additionally, we present a new simulation framework which rapidly
	assesses reliability and does not depend on manual identification
	of failure modes. Our evaluation illustrates that {CRAFT,} and hybrid
	techniques in general, offer attractive options in the fault-detection
	design space.},

	The target system is a gate-level implementation of a {DLX-like}
	processor. The synthesized design is simulated, and transients are
	injected to stress the processor while it is executing selected applications.
	Analysis of the collected data shows that fault sensitivity of the
	combinational logic (4.2\% for a fault duration of one clock cycle)
	is not negligible, even though it is smaller than the fault sensitivity
	of flip-flops (10.4\%). Detailed study of the error impact, measured
	at the application level, reveals that errors in speculation and
	control blocks collectively contribute to about 34\% of crashes,
	34\% of fail-silent violations and 69\% of application incomplete
	executions. These figures indicate the increasing need for processor-level
	detection techniques over generic methods, such as {ECC} and parity,
	to prevent such errors from propagating beyond the processor boundaries.},

	SafetyNect maintains multiple, globally consistent checkpoints of

	Performance overhead is minimized by pipelining checkpoint validation
	with subsequent parallel execution. Using full-system simulation
	of a 16-way multiprocessor system, the paper shows that SafetyNet
	adds statistically insignificant runtime overhead in the common-case
	(adds no latency to 99.99\% of all instructions) and avoids a crash

	and Redundantly Threaded processors with Recovery {(SRTR)} that enhances
	a previously proposed scheme for transient-fault detection, called
	Simultaneously and Redundantly Threaded {(SRT)} processors. {SRT}
	replicates an application into two communicating threads, one executing
	ahead of the other. The trailing thread repeats the computation performed
	by the leading thread, and the values produced by the two threads
	are compared. In {SRT} a leading instruction may commit before the
	check for faults occurs, relying on the trailing thread to trigger
	detection. In contrast, {SRTR} must not allow any leading instruction
	to commit before checking occurs, since a faulty instruction cannot
	be undone once the instruction commits. To avoid stalling leading
	instructions at commit while waiting for their trailing counterparts,
	{SRTR} exploits the time between the completion and commit of leading
	instructions. {SRTR} compares the leading and trailing values as
	soon as the trailing instruction completes, typically before the
	leading instruction reaches the commit point. To avoid increasing
	the bandwidth demand on the register file for checking register values,
	{SRTR} uses the register value queue {(RVQ)} to hold register values
	for checking. To reduce the bandwidth pressure on the {RVQ} itself
	{SRTR} employs dependence-based checking elision {(DBCE).} By reasoning
	that faults propagate through dependent instructions, {DBCE} exploits
	register (true) dependence chains so that only the last instruction
	in a chain uses the {RVQ,} and has the leading and trailing values
	checked. {SRTR} performs within 1\% and 7\% of {SRT} for {SPEC95}
	integer and floating-point programs, respectively. While {SRTR} without
	{DBCE} incurs about 18\% performance loss when the number of {RVQ}
	ports is reduced from four (which is performance-equivalent to an
	unlimited number) to two ports, with {DBCE,} a two-ported {RVQ} performs
	within 2\% of a four-ported {RVQ}},

	First, we load the code and data for a distrusted module into its
	own fault do main, a logically separate portion of the application's
	address space. Second, we modify the object code of a distrusted
	module to prevent it from writing or jumping to an address outside

	programming language {independent.Our} approach poses a tradeoff
	relative to hardware fault isolation: substantially faster communication
	between fault domains, at a cost of slightly increased execution

	can substantially improve end-to-end application performance.},

  abstract = {Dynamic optimization has the potential to adapt the program's behavior
	at run-time to deliver performance improvements over static optimization.
	Dynamic optimization systems usually perform their optimization in
	series with the application's execution. This incurs overhead which
	reduces the benefit of dynamic optimization, and prevents some aggressive
	optimizations from being performed. In this paper we propose a new
	dynamic optimization framework called Trident. Concurrent with the
	program's execution, the framework uses hardware support to identify
	optimization opportunities, and uses spare threads on a multithreaded
	processor to perform dynamic optimizations for these optimization
	events. We evaluate the benefit of using Trident to guide code layout,
	basic compiler optimizations, and value specialization. Our results
	show that using Trident with these optimizations achieves an average
	20\% speedup, and is complementary with other memory latency tolerant
	techniques, such as prefetching.},

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded-game theory-has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.},

@article{vandenberghe.boyd:semidefinite,
	Abstract = {In semidefinite programming, one minimizes a linear function subject to the constraint that an affine combination of symmetric matrices is positive semidefinite. Such a constraint is nonlinear and nonsmooth, but convex, so semidefinite programs are convex optimization problems. Semidefinite programming unifies several standard problems (e.g., linear and quadratic programming) and finds many applications in engineering and combinatorial optimization. Although semidefinite programs are much more general than linear programs, they are not much harder to solve. Most interior-point methods for linear programming have been generalized to semidefinite programs. As in linear programming, these methods have polynomial worst-case complexity and perform very well in practice. This paper gives a survey of the theory and applications of semidefinite programs and an introduction to primal-dual interior-point methods for their solution.},

Disciplined convex pro- grams, or DCPs, are convex optimization problems that are described using a limited set of construction rules, which enables them to be analyzed and solved efficiently. cvx can solve standard problems such as linear programs (LPs), quadratic programs (QPs), second-order cone programs (SOCPs), and semidefinite programs (SDPs); but compared to directly using a solver for one or these types of problems, cvx can greatly simplify the task of specifying the problem. cvx can also solve much more complex convex optimization problems, including many involving nondifferentiable functions, such as 1 norms. You can use cvx to conveniently formulate and solve constrained norm minimization, entropy maximization, determinant maximization, and many other problems.},
