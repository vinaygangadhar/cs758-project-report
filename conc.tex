\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec:conc}
Proximate is a programmable accelerator that targets high 
efficiency and programmability. Proximate is a compute engine 
for both regular and irregular workloads.
Proximate handles regular workloads with softbrain, 
a reconfigurable computation fabric operating on 
data streams recursively. Proximate handles irregular workloads with many CPU cores with data locality. 

Proximate is programmable with a task-based programming API. 
The programmer manages data sharding to achieve task and data locality for performance and scalability. 
The simple queueing model supports more concurrency with locality 
as each worker thread will only execute tasks in their own queue. 
Preliminary results shows that Proximate outperforms current 
multiprocessor programming paradigms by a factor of 10x for regular 
workloads and a factor of 2x for irregular workloads. Although
multi-threaded SoftBrain may cause new issues such as synchronization, 
schedule, and saturated memory bandwidth, it could uncover new bounds of performance. We leave multithreaded SoftBrain to future works.
