\section{Challenges} \label{sec:chal}
The challenges we faced is implementing a queueing model on zsim. 
The queueing model should mimic the Swarm style execution model 
to schedule and execute multiple irregular workloads concurrently. 
The challenge was debugging and getting to working in a short amount of time. 

Another challenge we faced is choosing the right base line for all 
experiments. Small workloads results in slowdown for pthreads and 
OpenMP while large workloads requires unaffordably slow runtimes on simulators. 
Furthermore, there were differences between real hardware (godel) and zsim, 
each of which shows peak speedup at different kernel size or different number of threads. 
Therefore, we had to run preliminary results to get a estimate of which workload 
configurations works well on which parallel programming paradigms.

Yet another challenge that we faced is the large design space of 
programming paradigms for a large set of workload. The programming 
paradigms includes sequential, OpenMP, pthreads, proximate_inorder, 
proximate_inorder_with_queueing, proximate_softbrain_only. The workload suites include
neural networks DianNao, image processing convolution engine, and 
irregular graph workloads, each of which has multiple benchmarks.
